# Python Projects

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ The projects I upload here are mostly for configuration purposes or small projects in Python. Please read below.

I hope this repo is helpful and inspirational for you.

Some recommendation
- you should write tests to avoid mistakes.
- you should provide observability to detect mistakes.
- you should know Algorithms, Data structures, and Design Patterns.
- you should know OOP, SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.
- you should know Architectures like microservice, monolithic, etc.
- the most important thing is to be curious and ask yourself if your implementation is the best one.
